en,Software Engineer,Part Time,Stadler,https://www.catedrastadler.com/,Valencia,2018,09,2019,02,"Catedra Stadler Rail Valencia. Matlab Software development with GUI. Predictive maintenance.","I worked on my own in the recovery and improvement of an abandoned software tool that was not working since the original developer left the project. Therefore my task was primarily to identify and solve the problems that made the app crash as soon as it was initialized. After that I repaired the app functionalities that were not working properly and finally I added more functionalities while I made the app UI intuitive for inexperienced users.\n This software tool is used in predictive train wheel maintenance. The disassembly of the train wheels is expensive and therefore the required inspections for the predictive maintenance are not economically viable. The software I worked on is connected to a hardware installed in the train that allows the inspection of the wheels without disassembling them."
