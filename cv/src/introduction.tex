\IntroductionWithQR{I want to invest my time in projects that can make a better
place to live for the current and future generations. Either by seeking more
efficient and sustainable solutions to actual problems or by developing
technologies that intend to restore the damage we cause to the environment. I
am a fast learner. Many of my programming skills are self-taught. That gives me
an edge in time-limited problems like hackathons and sprints. I am a team
player. Neither handball, business, nor competitions can be won alone.}
