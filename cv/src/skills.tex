\subsection{Object oriented programming}
Mainly Python, JavaScript and C++. With projects like a

connected alarm clock in a Raspberry Pi}, a
\href{https://github.com/esdandreu/esdandreu.github.io}{personal website}
and a C++ library and python extension for audio processing. I include basic
CI/CD in my projects to automate tedious development tasks like
building binaries or deploying the built application.

\subsection{Computer-Aided Design}

    parametric design with Fusion 360} which was later built and flown. Integrated
the computation of the static longitudinal stability analysis in the CAD
software, which accelerated the whole decision-making process.

\subsection{Simulation}
Using industrial software like Star-CCM+ for Computational Fluid Dynamics, Ansys
Mechanical for Finite Element Analysis and
