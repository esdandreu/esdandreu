As a \textbf{robotics and aerospace engineer}, I have developed a broad range
of technical skills that span from programming in multiple languages to
advanced design and simulation software expertise. I have experience using the
right tool for the job. Combining C++ for performance critical software that
interacts with mature libraries together with Golang for a fast-paced backend
development.

My public hobby projects include a
\href{https://github.com/esdandreu/WakePi}{Telegram controlled Spotify
connected alarm clock in a Raspberry Pi} developed in Python and a
\href{https://github.com/esdandreu/esdandreu.github.io}{personal website} using
React. My academic publications include
\href{https://github.com/AcousticOdometry/AO}{a C++ library for audio
processing accessible as a Python extension} used to train a Machine Learning
model that estimates motion using audio sensors:

Wheeled Robots on Loose Sandy Terrain DOI 10.1109/RoMoCo60539.2024.10604336}. 

I value my own developer experience and I put a strong emphasis on setting up
maintainable projects where it is satisfying to work. I prepare Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery workflows with GitHub Actions and Jenkins
to automate operational tasks like building binaries or deploying the built
application.
