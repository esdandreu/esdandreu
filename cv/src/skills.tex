% As a \textbf{robotics and aerospace engineer}, I have developed a broad range
% of technical skills that span from programming in multiple languages to
% advanced design and simulation software expertise. I have experience using the
% right tool for the job. Combining C++ for performance critical software that
% interacts with mature libraries together with Golang for a fast-paced backend
% development.

% My public hobby projects include a
